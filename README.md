<h1>Overview</h1>
For this assignment, you are going to load a series of files containing data and search the loaded data for specific criteria. That might sound a bit dry, but the files contain information about LEGO sets, and everyone loves LEGO! The structure of this assignment is a bit open-ended; you can solve this problem in any way that you see fit. That is the first part of the lab, which is worth <strong>20</strong> points. You will submit this portion on <strong>zyBooks</strong>, just like the previous assignments.

The second part of the lab involves interacting with the terminal, and providing <strong><u>command-line arguments</u></strong> to your application. You are going to use the <em>filename</em> as <strong>command-line argument</strong> of <em>main()</em>. To achieve this, you will modify the <strong>main.cpp</strong> file. This portion will be worth <strong>5</strong> points, and you will submit this via Canvas.

<h2>Description</h2>
First things first, the files: There are <strong>3</strong> main files that you will be loading in this assignment:

<ul>
<li><em>csv </em></li>
<li><em>csv </em></li>
<li><em>csv </em></li>
</ul>
In addition, there are <strong>3</strong> sample files included with this document. Use those to test your loading process. The 3 larger files (on zyBooks, without ‚ÄúSAMPLE_‚Äù in the filename) are in the exact same format, the sample files have just been reduced to a handful of entries, so you could easily test as you go.

The data that you will be loading is information about a LEGO set:

<ol>
<li><em>Its set number </em></li>
<li><em>The theme it comes from (City, Technic, Star Wars, etc.) </em></li>
<li><em>The name of the set </em></li>
<li><em>How many parts and mini-figures it contains (if any) </em></li>
<li><em>Its price in US dollars</em></li>
</ol>
Your goal is to read this from 1 of those 3 files (or all of them at once), store it, and then search it based on a few different criteria.

<strong>Main.cpp</strong> is only required for this assignment, <em>but</em> you are free to write any class/functions that you see fit to assist you solve this problem. Main.cpp has some structure to it already to help you get started. Take some time to <strong><em><u>think</u></em></strong> about how you might go about this before diving in.

<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>

<h1>Searches</h1>
The different searches you will perform will be based on a <em>menu</em> that might look like this:

<ol>
<li>Most expensive</li>
<li>Largest piece count</li>
<li>Search for set name containing‚Ä¶ 4. Search themes‚Ä¶</li>
<li>Part count information 6. Price information</li>
<li>Minifigure information</li>
<li>If you bought one of everything‚Ä¶</li>
</ol>

Get a string as input from the user. Then search all sets and their names to see if they contain the search term.

There could be a lot of sets matching the search term, so show them in a more concise, list format with the <em>set ID</em>, <em>name</em>, and <em>price</em>. If no sets are found, report that as well.

<h2>Reading Files</h2>
When reading a text file, all of the data typically gets read in as a string. If the final storage variable isn‚Äôt a string (such as a person‚Äôs age, or the price of something), you must convert it. In the <em>&lt;string&gt;</em> header file, there are a number of functions to help you convert. These function converts a STRING_TO_SOMETHING, and are named like <em>stoi</em> (string to integer), <em>stof</em> (string to float), etc.

The implementation of some of these functions may throw an exception of type ‚Äúinvalid_argument‚Äù if the conversion process fails, so you may want to encapsulate these operations in <em>try/catch</em> blocks, and use a default value if you catch an exception‚Äîif the number can‚Äôt be converted, (in this case) it‚Äôs because a value wasn‚Äôt there, so what would be a good value to use in the absence of anything else? Refer back to the section on Exceptions in your textbook if you need to.

<h1>Terminal</h1>
The reasoning behind interacting with the terminal is to increase your flexibility and exposure. It‚Äôs a great idea to utilize an IDE for enormous projects. However, there will be times where you will be required to use the terminal as a developer. You will live in the terminal world while enrolled in Operating Systems. The below definition gives a brief synopsis:

&nbsp;

‚ÄúThe command-line shell is a text-based user interface for your operating system. Unlike a GUI shell, which uses a graphical representation of the system‚Äôs services and resources, the command-line shell uses only text. It is the fundamental interface between you and the operating system, and in many cases offer you more direct control over the system processes.‚Äù

&nbsp;

Your goal in this portion of the lab is to pass in the <em>filename</em> when running your program. To achieve this, you can do the following:

<ol>
<li>Open up terminal and navigate to your project directory to compile it using <em>g++</em>
<ol>
<li>Refer to the <em>Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)</em> <strong>page</strong> in Canvas</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Run your program and pass in the filename as a parameter
<ol>
<li>E. ‚Äú<em>./main.out</em> <strong>lab5_sample.txt</strong>‚Äù</li>
<li>You should <em>throw -1</em> if the file doesn‚Äôt exist.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

From this, you should observe that testing is much faster. Make sure to refer to the <em>Useful Resources </em>section as it contains helpful articles.
